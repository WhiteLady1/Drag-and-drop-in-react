# Drag and Drop React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

Drag and Drop is a one-page application. On the main page you can see eight samples of chemicals we use in our homes. 
In the middle is an experimental table where you can move up to two samples of chemicals. Once selected, a mix button appears and you can mix the selected samples.
After a while, the result of the reaction will be displayed.

If you have changed your mind, you can click on a sample on the experemental table to deselect it.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
